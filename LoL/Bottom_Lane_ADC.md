# Bottom Lane ADC

## Habits

- before every decision/engage:
  - count enemies on minimap
    - uncertainty principle:
      eE- enemies are nearby until proven otherwise
    - engage only with man advantage
    - consider taking an objective (tower, baron, dragon,...) a disadvantage (+ 1 man for enemy team)

## Team Fights

- Stay alive
- Stay back
- Hit closest enemy
- Keep track of enemy kill spells
- Engage when all kill spells are on cooldown

## Kill Spells

- Mater Yi: Highlander (R)
- Nautilus: Dredge Line (Q)
- Nautilus: Depth Charge (R)

## Laning

- Goal: ~10 CS/min + take down tower
